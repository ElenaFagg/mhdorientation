Two images are given AIL.mhd and ASL.mhd, to convert them use Test or
the python script Test.py
To run Test:
./Test inputfile.mhd outputfile.mhd optionalangleselection
To run python version Test.py:
python Test.py

The script SurfaceExtraction and  SurfToRas
calls two vmtk commands that extract a .vtp surface from a .mhd at
a fixed isosurface, and then move the vtp surface on the metaimage
used for extraction.
SurfExtraction inputimage.mhd(RAS oriented!!) isosurface(int) outfile.vtp
SurfToRas inputimage.mhd(first argument of SurfExtraction) inputfile.vtp(output of SurfExtraction) outfile_RAS.vtp

Using Slicer3D is possible to observe the allignment of the converted .mhd and the surface transformed in RAS space.
The screenshot in .png files illustrate the results of the extraction and transformation post conversion.
